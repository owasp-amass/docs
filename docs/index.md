# :simple-owasp: Amass Docs 

**OWASP Amass** is an open-source, versatile Attack Surface Intelligence platform designed to comprehensively map an organizationâ€™s footprint. Built for flexibility and depth, Amass combines advanced data collection, network mapping, and OSINT capabilities to deliver detailed insights into physical and digital assets. 

## Overview

Amass extends far beyond basic subdomain enumeration, offering a comprehensive, automated approach to information gathering that reveals the full scope of an organization's infrastructure.


!!! info "Open Asset Model (OAM)"
    The `Open Asset Model` expands traditional asset specifications by covering physical and digital assets, providing a comprehensive view of an organization's attack surface.
    It defines assets and their relationships, capturing their real-world interconnectedness. The `OAM` allows for concurrent data collection and querying, automating the asset collection, analysis, and visualization process.

- **Automated Deployment and Enumeration:** Easily deploy Amass with [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) for quick, automated asset discovery across multiple domains with minimal configuration.

- **Centralized Asset Management with Asset DB:** Use the Asset DB for storing, managing, and retrieving discovered assets, with support for long-term tracking and consistent data collection through the Open Asset Model.

- **Scalable and Flexible Infrastructure:** Designed for enterprise environments, [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) enables scalable deployments of Amass, ensuring consistent attack surface management for organizations of any size.

- **Advanced Collection and Monitoring:** The Collections Engine refines the data collection process, while open-source tools like [syslog-ng](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng) provide centralized logging, enabling real-time monitoring and diagnostics.

- **Visualization and Data-Driven Insights:** The latest release features a fully integrated [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) dashboard, providing dynamic visualization and analysis for deeper attack surface intelligence.

## :octicons-tools-16: Getting Started 

Follow these steps to set up the OWASP Amass Project using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/):

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Docker:** Up-to-date intallation running on your system. You can download it from [Docker's Official Website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).
  
- **Docker Compose:** Typically, Docker Compose is bundled with Docker Desktop, but you can verify the installation or install it seperately from
    [Docker Compose Installation](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- **Git:** To clone the Amass repository. Download it from [Git's Official Website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

### Step 1: Clone the Amass Docker Compose Directory

Start by cloning the OWASP Amass repository, which contains the Docker Compose setup files.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/owasp-amass/amass-docker-compose.git
mv amass-docker-compose amass   # Optional: Rename the directory to something shorter (e.g., amass)
cd amass   # Navigate to local directory
```

### Step 2: Configure the Compose Environment

**> Open the `assetdb.env` File:**

Navigate to the `config` directory and open the `assetdb.env` file in a text editor to set the database passwords.

```bash
cd config
nano assetdb.env # (1)!
```

1.   You can replace `nano` with your preferred text editor, like `vim` or `code` for Visual Studio Code.


**> Set the Passwords:** 

In the `assetdb.env` file, locate the lines for `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` and `AMASS_PASSWORD`. Update them to assign new values. 

For example:

```bash
POSTGRES_PASSWORD= your_new_postgres_password
AMASS_PASSWORD= your_new_amass_password
```

!!! Warning
    This cannot be performed after you start the Docker Compose and the database has been created.

**> Save Changes:** 

After editing, save the file:

- If you're using **nano**: Press `Ctrl + O` (then hit `Enter`) to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit.

- If you're using **vim**: Press `Esc`, then type `:wq` and hit `Enter`.


**> Modify the `config.yaml` File:**

Open the `config.yaml` file to set the database password to the one you just assigned as `AMASS_PASSWORD`.

```bash
nano ../config.yaml
```

**> Update the Database Password:** 

Find the section in the `config.yaml` file that specifies the database settings. Change the password to match the `AMASS_PASSWORD` you set earlier.

For example:

```yaml
options:
  ...
  database: "postgres://amass:password@assetdb:5432/assetdb"
```

**> Save Changes:**

As before, save the changes using your preferred text editor.


!!! info "Update the Data Sources"
    If you want to configure data sources, you can modify the `datasources.yaml` file. Open it with:
    ```bash
    nano datasources.yaml
    ```
    Uncomment the lines you need, and provide any necessary credentials.

### Step 3: Building the Docker Images

Your **Amass** framework is now configured and ready to be built. [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) will build the required images and start them correctly when you perform your first Amass command execution.

**> Type the following to get started:**

```bash
docker compose run --rm amass enum -active -d example.org # (1)!
```

1.   If the build process times out, simply execute the command again to resume.


**> Accessing the Web UI:**

You can obtain information about your asset discoveries by accessing the web UI at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`

> All persistent data used exists on your host in the local repo root directory.

> The `assetdb` is a [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database reachable from your localhost on `port 55432`.

> The `config` files in the local repo are automatically mapped to where components expect to find them in the Docker environment.

!!! tip "Utilize the IP2Location Database" 
    - **Sign up** for a free [IP2Location LITE](https://lite.ip2location.com/) account.
    - **Download Database File:** Download the `IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.CSV` and `IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.IPV6.CSV` files.  
    - **Copy Files to the Compose Directory:** Copy the downloaded CSV files into the compose directory:
    ```bash
    cp path/to/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.CSV ./ 
    cp path/to/IP2LOCATION-LITE-DB11.IPV6.CSV ./
    ```
    - **Run the Amass Docker Compose:** While the Amass Docker Compose is up, execute the script to insert the geo information into the database:
    ```bash
    ./upload_ip2loc_data.sh
    ```


## :material-update: Update Process for the Compose Environment

**> Make the local repo your current working directory:**

```bash
cd amass
```

**> Shutdown the Amass framework within the Docker environment:**

```bash 
docker compose down
```

**> Backup the configuration files:**

```bash 
cp config/assetdb.env config/config.yaml config/datasources.yaml backups/
```

**> Backup the following directories: `assetdb` , `data` , `logs`.**

**> Update the local repo:**

```bash
git pull origin master
```

## :material-update: Update Process for the Docker Images

**> Make the local repo your current working directory:**
```bash
cd amass
```

**> Shutdown the Amass framework within the Docker environment:**

```bash
docker compose down
```

**> Update components from their GitHub repos:**

```bash
docker compose pull
docker compose build --pull --no-cache
```
