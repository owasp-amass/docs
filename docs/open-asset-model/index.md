# :simple-owasp: Open Asset Model

The **Open Asset Model (OAM)** redefines the understanding of an organization's attack surface. Shifting the paradigm away from narrow, internet infrastructure-focused collection, the **Amass** [Open&nbsp;Asset&nbsp;Model](https://github.com/owasp-amass/open-asset-model) broadens its scope to include both physical and digital assets. This approach delivers a complete view of an organizationâ€™s **assets and their relationships**, ensuring full visibility into the potential risks and attack vectors that might otherwise be overlooked.
