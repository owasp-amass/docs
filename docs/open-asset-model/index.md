# :simple-owasp: Open Asset Model

The **Open Asset Model (OAM)** redefines the understanding of an organization's attack surface. Shifting the paradigm away from narrow, internet infrastructure-focused asset collection, the **Open Asset Model** broadens its scope to include both physical and digital assets. This approach delivers a complete view of an organizationâ€™s **assets and their relationships**, ensuring full visibility into the potential risks and attack vectors that might otherwise be overlooked.

## :material-map-marker-outline: Key Features

- **Complete Asset Visibility:** Covers both **physical and digital** assets for a comprehensive view.
- **Standardized Asset Framework:** Ensures **consistency in asset classification** and data exchange across organizations.
- **Seamless Data Exchange:** Facilitates efficient sharing of **standardized asset inventories**.
- **Broader Attack Surface Awareness:** Identifies **vulnerabilities** beyond IT infrastructure.
- **Community-Driven:** Developed and continuously refined by security experts within the **OWASP Amass** ecosystem.
- **Risk Mapping:** Exposes hidden attack vectors by **mapping relationships** between assets."
