# :simple-owasp: Open Asset Model

The **Open Asset Model (OAM)** redefines the understanding of an attack surface. Shifting the paradigm away from narrow, internet infrastructure-focused collection, the **OAM** framework broadens its scope to include both physical and digital assets. This approach delivers a realistic view of **assets and their lesser-known associations**, utilizing adversarial tactics to gain visibility into potential risks and attack vectors that might otherwise be overlooked.

## :material-cogs: Key Benefits

- **Deep Attack Surface Intelligence:** Identifies both **physical and digital assets**, moving beyond IT infrastructure.
- **Standardized Asset Framework:** Ensures **consistency in asset classification**, facilitating efficient data exchange and streamlined analysis.
- **Cyclic Discovery:** Recursively approaches data exploration, leveraging each finding to dynamically **expand the target scope**.
- **Community-Driven:** Developed and continuously refined by security experts within the **OWASP Amass** ecosystem.
- **Risk Mapping:** Exposes hidden attack vectors by **mapping asset relationships** and tracking their changes over time.

!!! abstract "Open Asset Taxonomy"
    The `Open Asset Model` organizes assets into `Contact`, `Registration`, `Infrastructure`, `People`, `Organization`, and `Fingerprint` classes, bridging the relationships within and across these specifications.
    
### Explore each asset type and their distinct relationships:
